Hi. My name is silentstranger. I am doing some coding for fun. When I am not procrastinating (which is quite rare), I am doing stuff. When I want some flex chilling, I use Python. When I want to be smashed by computer many times in the row, I use C. When I want to try something new, I use Go. When I don't wanna code, I learn math or physics. When I don't wanna do anything (80% of the time), I watch anime or read manga. When I wanna suffer, I go study algorithms. It is fun. You should try it too. 

I doubt that I ever can graduate from self-study academy mostly because of how unproductive I am. Right now I am at the stage when I want to try something new. Probably I will abandon this idea yet again (is that third or fourth time already?), but until that moment, I hopefully would describe my adventures here.
